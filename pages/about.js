            Nice to meet you! My name is Nigar, I am an IT graduate and
            Front-end Developer based in Baku, Azerbaijan. I am very passionate
            about technology and everything that surrounds it. From gadgets to
            software, I am always up-to-date on the latest trends and
            advancements in the tech industry. Coding is my absolute favorite
            thing to do! It is a way for me to express my creativity while at
            the same time - solving problems. I am always looking for new
            challenges to test my skills and develop myself in finding solutions
            for different coding problems.
          </p>
          <p className="font-body text-sm md:text-base text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-100 mb-4">
            I am a solution-oriented person. I always look for ways to improve
            processes and create more efficient solutions. Whether it&apos;s a
            minor coding issue or a larger project, I am enthusiastic about
            tackling challenges head-on and finding the best possible solution.
            Researching new technologies and discovering new ideas is something
            that I enjoy doing in my daily life. I love exploring new
            possibilities and figuring out how to apply new concepts to my work.
            My keen eye for details comes in handy while I am trying to
            understand complex ideas or working on perfecting my code.

            As a self-taught Front-end Developer, I love learning new skills
            every day. I discovered my passion for web development at university
            and enjoy using the latest technologies to create user-friendly
            websites. I started with React, then learnt Tailwind CSS during an
            internship and started explore Next.js while building my portfolio.
            I am experienced in developing projects from wireframes to
            deployment and have gained confidence through each new challenge.
            Recently, I received a{" "}

            When I&apos;m not coding, I love to engage in activities that help
            me relax and recharge my batteries. I have created a daily habit of
            reading, which I absolutely love. It is a great way to unwind and
            escape into a world of imagination.
            <br />
            <br />
            To maintain focus and relieve stress, I also enjoy meditating. It is
            a powerful tool that helps me clear my mind and feel more centered.
            I practice yoga to relax my body, especially my back, which tends to
            get sore from sitting at a desk for extended periods of time.
            <br />
            <br />
            As entertaining activities, I listen to music or play arcade games.
            One of my favorite desktop games is The Sims 4, which allows me to
            indulge my creative side while having some fun. Occasionally, I get
            lost in the world of YouTube or Netflix series, which is a great way
            to unwind and relax.
            <br />
            <br />
            Aside from screen time, I love spending time with cats, as they
            always bring me joy and comfort. I also enjoy drawing, which is a
            great way to express my creativity. But nothing beats spending time
            with my family and friends, whether going out for a meal, watching a
            movie, or simply enjoying each others company.
